### 👋 Hey! I'm Ayon.
I'm a teenage UI Designer, learning Web Developer, and a aspiring entrepreneur.
 
## ✨ What I'm currently doing
I am practicing my HTML & CSS skills to build really cool websites. I'm also learning web development on a course on Udemy designed from a professional developer.

## 👀 Experience
As of now, I'd say I have a decent foundation of HTML & CSS. UI Designing is probably my top skill as of now, because time-to-time I like to create web designs, concepts, and more.

## ⭐ Goals
My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer, and to have a correct mindset of a developer.
